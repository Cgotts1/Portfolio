        </aside>

        <p class = "aboutparagraph"> <br>Currently a UCSD bootcamp student working towards becoming a fullstack developer. I have a B.A. in Anthropology as well as a MSc in Forensic Anthropology. 
            My goals after completing this course is to find a job within the tech industry as a software engineer and then later transition into UX research in order to utilize my anthropological
            background. In addition to my passion for learning new skills, I have developed a passion for teaching new skills through my work experience in the United States K-12 public school system.
            While teaching can be very rewarding, it can also be mentally taxing, so classroom management has become an essential tool I rely on daily in order to maintain sanity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Below is a portfolio of work that I have accumulated over the past year with applications focusing on education and anthropology. While I believe that these applications provide real 
            world value to those who work in education, as well as those who do anthropological field work, I think it may benefit anyone who would like to gain insight into human behavior
            and how we learn as a society.
